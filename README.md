##  Setup Instructions

### Local Development

git clone https://github.com/anamivale/spa
cd spa
go run cmd/main.go
```

### Production Deployment on Render

1. **Environment Variables**: Set these in your Render dashboard:
   - `ENVIRONMENT=production`
   - `PORT` (automatically set by Render)

2. **Security Features**:
   - ‚úÖ CSRF protection on all state-changing requests
   - ‚úÖ Environment-based configuration
   - ‚úÖ Session management with automatic cleanup

3. **Deploy**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Render
   - Use the included `render.yaml` configuration
   - Render will automatically build and deploy

### Security Improvements Made

- **Cookie Security**: All cookies now use `HttpOnly`, `Secure` (in production), and `SameSite=Strict` flags
- **CSRF Protection**: All POST requests require CSRF tokens
- **Environment Detection**: Different security settings for development vs production
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced client-side and server-side validation
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and user feedback
